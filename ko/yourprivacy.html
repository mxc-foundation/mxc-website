          <h2>MXC DATA DASH Global Privacy Policy (Including E.U. Residents and Citizens)</h2>
          <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information MXC Foundation gGmbH. (“MXC”) gathers about you, the source of that information, what we use that information for, the lawful basis on which that information is used, and who we share that information with when you use products, services, content, features, technologies or functions offered by MXC, the MXC Data Dash application and all related sites, applications, and services (collectively, the “MXC Services”).

          <p><strong>1.2 Legal Basis:</strong> We are required by the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) to set out in this Privacy Policy the legal grounds on which we rely in order to process your information. We generally process your information because:</p>
          <p>a) (a) it is necessary for the legitimate interests of the subsidiaries, affiliated companies and other related corporations of  MXC (collectively, the <strong>“MXC Foundation gGmbH”</strong>), including our interests in fulfilling the purposes in Section 3 below and when we make the disclosures referred to in Section 5 below, necessary for providing products and services of a consistently high standard, keeping our customers satisfied, and meeting our accountability and regulatory requirements around the world, in each case provided such interests are not overridden by your privacy interests;</p>
          <p>b) it is necessary for us to enter into, and perform our obligations under, our contract with you, such as when we use your data for the purposes in Section 3 below;</p>
          <p>c) it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation under, for example, EU law or the laws of another international State (e.g. any mandatory disclosures to an authority, regulator or government body); and</p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>in some cases, we have obtained your prior consent.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>1.3 Information:</strong> For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the term <strong>“information”</strong> means any information about you that we or our third party service providers collect from you or a third party, including such information set out in Section 2 below.

We will post the notice on our website followed by a notification to you by e-mail.</p>
          <p>1.5 <strong>Third Party Websites or Applications:</strong> Some pages on the websites or mobile Applications of the MXC Foundation or parts of MXC Services may include links to third-party websites.

          <ol role="list">
            <li>name;</li>
            <li>address;</li>
            <li>phone number;</li>
            <li>the details of your identification document(s); and</li>
            <li>email address.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>b) <strong>Topping up and making payments</strong><br>To top-up your available balance of your MXC wallet / account, or make certain payments through the MXC Services, we need (where applicable):</p>
          <ul role="list">

            <li>other additional commercial and/or identification information, if you send or receive certain high-value transactions or high overall payment volumes through the MXC Services, or we are otherwise required by anti-money laundering laws and regulations to do so.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>c) <strong>Know-Your-Client/Anti-Money Laundering information from third parties and other sources:</strong></p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>In order to complete our user screening and identity verification process, including checks in relation to fraud detection and prevention, anti-money laundering, know-your-client and countering of the financing of terrorism, we may have to verify the information you provide to the MXC Foundation, payment partners, service providers and fraud agencies as well as information available through internet and publicly accessible social network data. </li>
            <li>We need may ask you to upload a picture of yourself, if so, your face must be recognizable in order for us to complete our customer screening and identity verification process.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>d) <strong>Confirmations and additional information</strong></p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>If we cannot verify the information that you provide, for whatever reason, we may ask you to upload or send us additional confirmations or to answer additional questions online to help verify your information is up to date and correct.</li>
            <li>If you send or receive high overall payment volumes or display inconsistent transactional patterns through MXC Services, or if you have a limited transactional history with us, we may conduct a background check on you by obtaining information about you and/or your business, and potentially (if legally permitted) also about your directors, shareholders and partners, from a credit reference or fraud agency. If you owe us money, we may obtain additional information about you from a fraud agency, to the extent permitted by law. MXC, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to periodically retrieve and review a business and/or consumer credit report supplied by such credit reference or fraud agency for any account, and reserves the right to close an account based on information obtained during this credit review process.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>2.2 Provision of the MXC Services:</strong> We also will collect the following information to provide you with the MXC Services:<br>(a) <strong>Using your Device:</strong></p>
          <p>When you use MXC Services using any device (whether connected to MXC wirelessly or otherwise), we may additionally collect and store device sign-on data (including but not limited to device ID) and geolocation data in order to provide the MXC Services and your overall experience.</p>
          <p>(b) <strong>Loyalty Information:</strong></p>
          <p>If we allow you to link your membership of an eligible loyalty scheme to your account, we need your loyalty scheme membership details to enable us to track your membership and calculate applicable fees, discounts or other loyalty benefits.</p>
          <p>(c) <strong>Transaction Information:</strong></p>
          <p>When you use the MXC Services to send funds to someone else, we will ask you to provide information related to that transaction. This information may include the amount and type of transaction (such as purchase or trade of data, purchase of services, or a simple peer-to-peer transfer), and the details pertaining to the identity of the third party. Also, when you send token(s) to another MXC Services user, you may be asked to provide your personal details to that customer to complete the transaction. Your personal details may then be passed on to us from that customer. We also collect the IP address and other identifying information about the computer or device you use to access your MXC account or use the MXC Services, in order to help detect possible instances of unauthorized transactions.</p>
          <p>(d) <strong>Website / Application Traffic Information:</strong></p>
          <p>Because of the way Internet communication standards work, when you arrive at or leave the MXC Application or website, we automatically receive the web address of the site that you came from or are going to. We also collect information on the pages of our Application or website which you visit, IP addresses, the type of browser you use and the times you access our Application or website.</p>
          <p>(e) <strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, Local Storage and Similar Technologies:</strong></p>
          <p>When you access our website or use MXC Services, we (including companies we work with) may place small data files on your mobile, computer or other devices. These data files include cookies, pixel tags, Flash cookies, or other local storage provided by your browser or associated applications (collectively <strong>&quot;Cookies&quot;</strong>). We use Cookies to recognize you as a customer, customize MXC Services, content and advertising, measure promotional effectiveness, help ensure that your account security is not compromised, mitigate risk and prevent fraud, and to promote trust and safety across our sites and the entire MXC Services. You are free to decline our Cookies if your browser or browser add-on permits, unless our Cookies are required to prevent fraud or ensure the security of websites we control. However, declining our Cookies may interfere with your use of our website or application and the overall MXC Services and your general experience.</p>
          <p>(f) <strong>Communications:</strong></p>
          <p>When you communicate with us for customer service or other purposes (e.g., via email, phone calls, tweets, or other modes of communication, etc.), or provide any feedback, we retain such information and our responses to you in the records of your account.</p>
          <p>(g) <strong>Questionnaires, Surveys, Sweepstakes:</strong></p>
          <p>From time to time, we may offer optional questionnaires, surveys and sweepstakes to our users for such purposes as collecting demographic information or assessing users&#x27; interests and needs. If we collect personally identifiable information from our users in these questionnaires, surveys, and sweepstakes, the users will be given notice of how the information will be used prior to their participation in the survey, questionnaire or sweepstake.</p>
          <p>(h) <strong>Profile Data:</strong></p>
          <p>We may also collect public information about your business and your behavior on social media platforms (such as your e-mail address and the number of “likes” and “followers”), to the extent relevant to confirm an assessment of your transactions and/or your business, including its size and the size of its customer base.</p>
          <p>2.3 We set out in Section 3 below greater detail (in addition to what is set out in the foregoing of this Section 2) on how we use the information we collect.</p>
          <h2>3. How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>We will use your Account Information to provide MXC Services. In particular, we will use your information for the following purposes:</p>
          <p><strong>3.1 Internal Uses:</strong> Our primary purpose in collecting your information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, better, efficient, and customized experience in your use of the MXC Services. We do this by processing your information to:</p>
          <p>(a) seamlessly process transactions and provide the MXC Services;</p>
          <p>(b) complete our customer screening and identity verification process including checks in relation to fraud detection and prevention, anti-money laundering, in certain cases: know-your-client and the countering of the financing of terrorism;</p>
          <p>(c) resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;</p>
          <p>(d) manage risks and carry out investigations, in relation to any illegal activity or potential illegal activity or transactions for breach or potential breach of our terms and conditions;</p>
          <p>(e) provide you with customer support services;</p>
          <p>(f) improve the MXC Services by customising your user experience;</p>
          <p>(g) measure the performance of MXC Services and improve their content and layout;</p>
          <p>(h) manage and protect our information technology infrastructure;</p>
          <p>(i) provide targeted marketing and advertising, service updates, and deliver promotional offers based on the communication preferences you have defined for your MXC account (please refer to the section &quot;Our Contact with MXC Customers&quot; below) and your activities when using the MXC Services; and</p>
          <p>(j) perform potential creditworthiness and solvency checks, compare information for accuracy, and verify it with third parties.</p>
          <p><strong>3.2 Questionnaires, Sweepstakes, Surveys and Profile Data:</strong> If you choose to answer our optional questionnaires or surveys, we may use such information to improve the MXC Services, send you marketing or advertising information, manage the sweepstakes, or as otherwise explained in detail in the survey itself.</p>
          <p><strong>3.3 Our Contact with you, the MXC Users &amp; Customers:</strong> We communicate with our users on a regular basis via email and chats to provide requested services. We may also communicate with our users by phone or email to:</p>
          <p>(a) resolve customer complaints or claims made by users;</p>
          <p>(b) respond to requests for customer service;</p>
          <p>(c) inform users if we believe their accounts or any of their transactions have been used for an illegitimate purpose;</p>
          <p>(d) confirm information concerning a user&#x27;s identity, business or account activity;</p>
          <p>(e) carry out collection activities;</p>
          <p>(f) conduct customer surveys; and</p>
          <p>(g) investigate suspicious transactions.</p>
          <p>We use your email or physical address to confirm your opening of an MXC account, to send you notices in relation to MXC Services or notifications that you send or receive through MXC, to send you information about important changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures required by law. Generally, users cannot opt out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional and we will do our utmost to limit such communications for your convenience.</p>
          <p>We also use your email address to send you other types of communications that you can control, including &quot;news”, “notifications”, and “notice of special third-party promotions”. You can choose whether to receive some, all or none of these communications when you complete the registration process, or at any time thereafter, by logging in to your account and then selecting settings and updating your preferences.</p>
          <p><strong>3.4 Other purposes:</strong> In some cases, we will also use your information for the purposes of, or in connection with:</p>
          <p>(a) independent audits of our financial statements and operations – the auditors may seek to contact a sample of our customers to confirm that our records are accurate. However, these auditors cannot use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes;</p>

          <p>Such entities include security forces, competent governmental, inter-governmental bodies, regulatory authorities and recognised self-regulatory authorities. Disclosure to such entities will be made where (i) the law (including but without limitation the GDPR, the applicable regulations on the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (the <strong>“FATCA Law”</strong>), and regulations on the OECD common reporting standard (the <strong>“CRS Law”</strong>)) compels or permits us; or (ii) we have reason to believe it is appropriate for us to cooperate with such entities for checks in relation to fraud detection and prevention, anti-money laundering, know-your-client and countering of the financing of terrorism, or investigations in relation to any other illegal activity or potential illegal activity. If you are covered by the FATCA Law or the CRS Law, we are required to give you notice of the information about you that we may transfer to various authorities.</p>
          <p><strong>5.2 Disclose necessary information to other third parties such as payment processors, auditors, financial products providers, business partners, marketing and public relations agencies, shipping and courier companies, MXC Foundation companies, marketplaces, service providers and your agents or legal representatives:</strong></p>

          <p><strong>5.4 Grant access to information in event of mergers or acquisitions involving MXC:</strong></p>
          <p>As with any other business, it is possible that in the future MXC could merge with, or be acquired by, another company. If such merger or acquisition occurs, the successor company will have access to your Account Information maintained by MXC, and this Privacy Policy continues to apply to such successor company unless and until it is amended.</p>
          <p><strong>5.5 Disclosing transactional details of MXC users in event of transfer of funds between them:</strong></p>
          <p>If you are a registered MXC user and you are sending funds or transacting with another registered MXC user, as a part of the transaction, the name, email address, date of sign-up and pertinent transactional details of both parties will be shared as a part of transaction notification.</p>
          <p><strong>5.6 Disclosing information to sellers when MXC users use purchase goods/services using the MXC Services:</strong></p>
          <p>If you are buying goods or services and pay via the MXC Application: If an attempt to pay your seller fails, or is later invalidated, we may also provide your seller with details of the unsuccessful payment. To facilitate dispute resolutions, we may provide a buyer with the seller&#x27;s details such as email address in order to clear a dispute.</p>
          <p><strong>5.7 Disclosing information to third party service providers who facilitate payments from or to you:</strong></p>

We use this information to confirm that you are a MXC customer and that MXC can be enabled to make a payment, or where a payment is sent to you to send you a notification that you have received a payment. Also, if you request that we validate your status as an MXC customer with a third party, we will do so. Please note that third parties you receive funds or buy from may have their own privacy policies, and MXC is not responsible for their operations, including but not limited to their information handling practices.</p>

          <h2>8. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Analytics as well as other 3rd party Applications (with anonymization function)</h2>
          <p><br></p>
          <p>8.1 By using the MXC application or website, MXC Services, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function). Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed. Web analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.</p>
          <p>The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>8.2  For the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the application &quot;_gat. _anonymizeIp&quot;. By means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.</p>
          <p>The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website. Google uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>8.3  Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google. During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.</p>
          <p>The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject. With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.</p>
          <p>The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such. For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a> and install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google. If the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>8.4  Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a> and under <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html</a>. Google Analytics is further explained under the following Link <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">https://www.google.com/analytics/</a>.</p>
